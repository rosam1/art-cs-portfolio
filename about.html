                <p>This website is a portfolio for showcasing what I learned from my art and coding classes this summer. 
                    In terms of graphic design, I learned how to think like a designer using the design process, and create 
                    good design using principles such as balance, alignment, repetition, consistency, etc. I also got hands 
                    on experience creating images on paper and digitally, as well as using typography to add meaning and structure 
                    to a design. I also experimented with using shapes and color, and learned how to utilize different aspects 
                    of contrast (such as scale and direction) to create an engaging visual design and to guide the viewer's eye. 
                    Finally, I created two album covers for a fictional band that tied all of these different aspects of design 
                    together into one piece. </p>
                <p>In terms of web design, I learned how to use HTML to put content on a webpage, and CSS to 
                    add style, with features such as layout, fonts and colors, transitions and animations, etc. I also learned 
                    how to use Bootstrap to add responsive JavaScript features like slideshows and popups. </p>
